(This is a [now page][nowabout].)

I have defined five principal values for myself and I try to ensure my 
attention is somewhat balanced over each of them which is why I like to
structure my goals around them:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Goals that are currently consuming my time</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Integrity</td>
    <td>Figure out who I am and want to be, from a career planning point of view; Improving my time use analysis software.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Love</td>
    <td>Reconnect with some of my friends that I have barely talked to during the past 5 years.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Liberty</td>
    <td>Establish a personal website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cultivation</td>
    <td>Broaden my skills in machine learning; Finish my business strategy related thesis; Graduate from Aalto.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Service</td>
    <td>Transition from part-time to full-time employment according to my career plans.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
