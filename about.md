I am a student of business strategy, software engineering and data science who
plans to graduate this spring from Aalto University. I am also a
dancer, a cyclist, a runner, a fitness enthusiast, a hiker, a photographer,
a traveler, a friend, and a husband.

[//]:    You can find more about me from my CV page draft,
[//]:      new blog
[//]:    and social media profiles below.

Note that I established this expression of online presence known as a 
personal website to help me collect, organise and share some of the many bits
of who I am and what I do both on- and offline for easier access by myself
and others.
