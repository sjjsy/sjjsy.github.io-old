## Hello!

**I am Samuel and I created this website to make it easier for you to learn 
about me**. I believe in informed and data-based decision making in everything 
we do which is why transparency and access to information is important. I hope 
this website helps in building a more complete picture of who I am and who I 
might become.

I am a fresh **alumni of Aalto University** Department of Industrial 
Engineering and Management. I majored on **strategy and venturing** but also 
studied data science, analytics and a lot of software engineering. I am eager 
to launch a successful and quickly evolving **career in consulting**. Why 
consulting? To sustain a high rate of learning! I aspire to one day have the 
confidence and expertise to leaderfully collaborate in the birth and growth of 
a new world-scale technology-based business venture in Finland.

I am also a West Coast Swing **dancer**, an all-year commute **cyclist**, a 
long-distance **runner**, a martial arts and **fitness enthusiast**, a 
**quantified self geek**, a **nature lover**, a **photographer**, a 
**friend**, and a **loving husband**. I vouch for liberty, human rights and 
the rule of law, democracy, and social, economic, and environmental 
sustainability. I think eradicating corruption in all its forms is one of the 
most urgent socio-political challenges. To balance my use of my time and 
energy across all of what I love and aspire to achieve I apply the 
[GTD][urlgtd] methodology.

I **love witnessing growth**, progress and learning. **This love inspires me 
to invest, build, cultivate, monitor and analyze**. This partially also 
explains why I created this website. I enjoy the idea and activity of 
collecting, organizing and sharing some of the many bits of who I am and what 
I have done -- how I have progressed -- both on- and offline for easier access 
and analysis by myself and others.
