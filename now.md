This [now page][nowabout] presents my current goals structured around the five 
principal values that I have defined for myself a long time ago:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th> <th>Goals that are currently consuming my time</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Integrity</td> <td>Figure out what firm, role and community would let 
    me grow and develop my skills, networks and know-how such that I am later 
    best able to do the kind of service that I want to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Love</td> <td>Progress with the goals that I share with my wife; 
    Reconnect with some of my friends that I have barely talked to during the 
    past 5 years.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Liberty</td> <td>Freely explore my professional interests and skills 
    more broadly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cultivation</td> <td>Kickstart my career as a full-time professional 
    and expert, cultivating the skills that I need in the work; Advance as a 
    West Coast Swing dancer such as to gain at least 7 WSDC registry points by 
    the end of Summer 2020.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Service</td> <td>Kickstart my career as a full-time professional and 
    expert that is able to help colleagues and clients at important and 
    challenging problems.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
