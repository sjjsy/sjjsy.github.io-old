Today, I scrapped my old website exercise draft and replaced it with minimal
foundations of my personal website.

I did this because I increasingly want to shift my online presence from
commercial social media services to my own personal website that I can
completely control and personalize. I like the traditional, simple and elegant
concept of a personal website.

I opted for a static design for its simplicity, robustness and elegance and 
[Jekyll][jekyllrb] for its maturity and GitHub compatibility. First I'm going 
to have it generously hosted by GitHub but it might very well find a new home 
soon.

I hope it's all downhill from here. :)
